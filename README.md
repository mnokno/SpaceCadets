## NameScratcher
Challenge 1 - Web scraping to extract a person's name from an email ID.

## BareBonesInterpreter
Challenge 2 - Build a bare-bones interpreter to take a text file and produce an output. This sub-project involves implementing a simple programming language that can execute basic commands.

## BoneWithFleshInterpreter
Challenge 3 - Extend the bare bones language interpreter. This sub-project builds on the previous challenge by adding additional functionality and commands to the interpreter.

## ChatApp

## Spirograph
Challenge 5 - Write an applet that makes spirographs. This sub-project involves implementing a graphical application that can generate and display spirographs based on user input.

## CircleDetection
Challenge 6 - Circle detection (Computer Vision). This sub-project involves implementing computer vision algorithms to detect circles in images.

## CircleDetector
Challenge 7 - Build a mobile application. This sub-project builds on the previous challenge by implementing a mobile application that can detect circles in real-time using the device's camera.

Each sub-project has its own folder within the repository, containing the necessary files and instructions to complete the challenge. Feel free to explore the sub-projects and try your hand at completing the challenges!
